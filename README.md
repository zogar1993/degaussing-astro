## Want to report a bug or propose an enhancement for the degaussingcomic.com website?

I really appreciate it! Go to the [Issues sections](https://github.com/zogar1993/degaussing-astro/issues) and create a
new issue there, I promise to take a look.

## Page characteristics

The page was made with a list of concerns in mind, namely it needs to...:
- ...be fast so that there is not a huge wait time, particularly from slow internet connections.
- ...be lightweight, so that users relying on mobile data don't get drained out.
- ...look well on any device.
- ...respect user privacy.

### Privacy

The best way to talk about privacy is to talk about the third-party tools we use and why we use them.
